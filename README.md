# News_Scrapping
I collected article titles and their corresponding sections, such as "us," "world," and "music," through web scraping on The New York Times. This data was organized into a CSV file with columns for the article section and title. Subsequently, I developed a machine learning model, likely using a text classification approach, trained on these titles to predict the section of a news article. The model, along with any necessary components like a TF-IDF vectorizer, was saved using the pickle library. Using PyCharm, I created a Streamlit web application that takes a user-inputted news article title and then the app will predict the section in which news should be.
